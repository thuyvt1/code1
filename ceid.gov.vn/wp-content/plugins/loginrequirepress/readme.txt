Easy way to require user login to view specific pages / posts.

== Description ==

Overview:

  At the time of this writing, the latest version of WordPress, version 4.9.8,
  has 3 post visibility options, which are 'public', 'password protected', and
  'private'.

  The 'password protected' option allows the site administrator to
  individually lock certain posts, even from the logged in users, with an
  additional password / passcode.  However, there is currently no built-in way
  to just deny access only to the unauthenticated users.

  Login Require Press is a WordPress plugin that allows site administrators to
  specifically designate arbitrary posts with any public post type as viewable
  only after user login.

  It is an easy way to require login to view specific pages / posts.

  Unauthenticated site visitors attempting to view any page that includes any
  such specifically designated post will then be automatically redirected to
  the site's default login page, and then back to the original page after they
  login, thereby limiting access only to logged-in users with subscriber roles
  and above.

  Plugin will still allow unauthenticated downloading of site's feeds, but
  will filter out all login-requiring posts from the feed listings.

  Plugin will protect the titles and contents of login-requiring posts in
  search result page listings when the user is not logged in.  The titles /
  contents will be replaced by text "[Post title / content protected by
  Login Require Press.  Login to see the title / content.]"

Technical summary:

  Plugin works by hooking-in special logic into the action 'send_headers' to
  redirect unauthenticated client browsers to the site's login page from any
  non-feed and non-search-results page upon detecting any login-requiring post,
  and by hooking-in another special logic into the filter 'posts_results' to
  filter out all login-requiring posts from all feed page listings, and to
  protect the titles and contents of login-requiring posts in search result
  page listings.

  Login-requiring posts are marked with a custom field 'login_require_press' set to 'yes'.
